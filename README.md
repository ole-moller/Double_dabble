The double_dabble main module converts 8-bit binary numbers to decimal numbers
displayed on a 7-segment display as sequences of 3 BCD digits followed by a decimal point.
If the binary number is changed outside the time frame of the decimal point the result will temporarily be garbled.

The conversion is done with the Double Dabble algoritm where each of the 8 loop iterations uses a 12-bit register
that can hold 3 groups of 4 bits (that will later become the BCD digits) to implements the core part of the algoritm,
which shifts all 12 bits to the left and injects the next bit from the input, and then for each group
of 4 bits adds the value 3 (binary 0011) if the value of the group is 5 (binary 0101) or above.
Adding 3 before the left shift corresponds to adding 6 after the shift, which in effect generates a carry into the next group of 4 bits.
This in effect ensures that each group of 4 bits cannot overflow as can be seen from the fact that the greatest number that is not
modified by addition is 4, which after left shifting and injection of a 1 exeed 9.

The conversion is implemented by combinational logic that unrolls the loop above, while presentation of the decimal result
is implemented with a state machine that sequentially displays hundreds, tens, ones, and finally a decimal point before starting over.

The device has an 8-bit input for the binary number, an 8-bit output for the 7-segment display with decimal point, and
an 8-bit bidirectional port that always outputs the tens and the ones from the conversion. This comes for free and is part of the testing.

The lowest external clock is 1 Hz and by dividing it by 4 allows ample time to observe the output on the 7-segment display.
The reset signal ensures that the divided clock starts low and that the state machine for presenting the decimal result starts with a decimal point.
